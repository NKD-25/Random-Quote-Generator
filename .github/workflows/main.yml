project:
  name: Random Quote Generator
  description: Frontend configuration procedure for the Random Quote Generator project
  version: 1.0.0

prerequisites:
  - Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
  - Text editor or IDE (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)
  - Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

frontend_files:
  - index.html
  - style.css (if separate from index.html)
  - script.js (if separate from index.html)
  - assets/
    - images/
    - fonts/

configuration_steps:
  - step: 1
    title: Setup Project Directory
    description: >
      Create a project folder and place all frontend files inside it. Organize assets such as images and fonts into appropriate subdirectories.

  - step: 2
    title: HTML Structure
    description: >
      Ensure `index.html` includes:
        - Basic HTML5 structure
        - References to CSS (either inline or linked stylesheet)
        - References to JavaScript (either inline or linked script)

  - step: 3
    title: Styling Configuration
    description: >
      Edit `style.css` or the <style> section in `index.html` to define the appearance of the quote generator, including fonts, colors, and layout.

  - step: 4
    title: JavaScript Setup
    description: >
      Add or update JavaScript in `script.js` or within a <script> tag in `index.html` to:
        - Load a set of quotes
        - Implement the logic to display random quotes
        - Add event listeners for user interaction (e.g., button clicks)

  - step: 5
    title: Testing the Application
    description: >
      Open `index.html` in a supported web browser and verify:
        - Quotes display correctly on load and on button press
        - Styling appears as expected across different screen sizes

  - step: 6
    title: Optional Enhancements
    description: >
      Consider adding features such as:
        - Categories for quotes
        - Automatic quote refresh intervals
        - Sharing quotes on social media

notes:
  - The frontend for this project is self-contained and runs entirely in the browser.
  - No build tools or backend servers are necessary unless expanding functionality.
  - Keep all files relative to one another to ensure links work correctly.

troubleshooting:
  - Issue: Quotes do not display
    solution: Check that the JavaScript is properly linked and no console errors occur.

  - Issue: Styles not applied
    solution: Verify the path to the CSS file or check inline styles in `index.html`.

  - Issue: Button click does not update quote
    solution: Ensure event listeners are correctly attached and JavaScript logic is error-free.
